# How to use it

The best way to use this material is to start with the presentation in xai/material. Take a method, open the associated exercise in xai/notebooks and solve it. Try to solve any errors you encounter by researching on different platforms. If you fail, you might check out the solution that is in the same folder where the exercise is.
